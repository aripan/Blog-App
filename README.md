## My Blog App

A fully responsive Blog app is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and NodeJS.

## Functionality

1. Shows the list of blog posts so that an user can see the blog and topics to choose.

2. An user can navigate to an individual blog post to read all of its content.

3. An user (later on, I might restrict it to an admin only), can easily add a new post to the blog.
